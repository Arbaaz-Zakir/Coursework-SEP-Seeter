    got working the mvc with command design pattern with mvc actually working however for it to work i had to pass the view the model which i feel some what breaks away from mvc where they see each other. have not yet implemented the additional features

    believed to have created all the methods that implement command design however i am not 100% as some commands take a model as a paramater which i feel creates coupling so that may be changed later. i also need to implemnt all of these commands which i may do later

    updated enums tested on early version of model to if they work which they do. also have a toString() method in enums. however currently not sure if i actually need TERMINATED state as at the point the program ends so is there a point?
